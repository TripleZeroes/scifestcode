create gameObject class
    - contains logic for game state and actions
    - use game state object with main game
    - update function with input
        - take an action and update information
        - return a game state (e.i. game over?) or just check the game state after an update?


implement algorithm

Make logic for opposite direction movement inputs when you have more than a head



think of things i want in my presentation
    -read about NEAT
        write a page about it in booklet
        touch on it in poster
    -think of a way to document my progress
    -how many generations to a good snake AI
        over 20 score

    -human data vs AI data
        get people to play the game
        figure out how many games people need to play
        figure out how many generations the AI should get









DONE I THINK
- game data:
        - grid where cells are: empty, snakehead, snakebody, apple
            - NEAT input
            - 2d array
        - apple location
        - snake data
        - head
        - direction
            - NEAT input
