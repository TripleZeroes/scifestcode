1. only length of snake

2. factored in the duration of the game

3. started multiplying the length of snake by 10 to encourage apple eating

4. started multiplying the length of snake by 100 to heavily encourage apple eating

5. the AI was zig-zagging back and forth to increase game duration so I took points away for every move that was a zig-zag

6. gave points for each movement

7. started triangulating the distance from the apple and giving points based on how close/far the snake was from it 

8. sometimes the AI would run into an apple even though it only made one move so I got rid of points given if the AI had only made one move

9. the AI was still zig-zagging so it lost a large amount of points if it zig-zagged at all

10. I modified the points given with new movements to encourage moving more

11. changed apple distance points to factor in starting distance, this gave even more points if the AI got closer to the apple
