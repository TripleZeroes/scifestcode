only length_of_snake 
length_of_snake + duration: so that AI is encouraged to last longer
length_of_snake * 10 + duration: apple eating is heavily encouraged
length_of_snake * 100 + duration: apple eating is VERY heavily encouraged and genomes were zig-zagging back and forth to increase duration smh
length_of_snake * 100 + duration - amount of opposite movements: this heavily discouraged the back-tracking for duration
length_of_snake * 100 + duration - amount of opposite movements + amount of direction changes * 0.5: this is meant to give the AI a little push in the direction of wanting to move more

next test ;)
    mean_distance = statistics.mean(distances)
    new_distance_score = (1/mean_distance) * 20
    genome.fitness = (self.game.score * 100) + duration - amount_of_retakes + (new_directions * 0.5) + new_distance_score

    triangulation dis from apple

negated point gain if AI ate apple through lazyness
greatly penalized zig zagging back and forth

TODO
better encourage movement towards apple
better promote movement
